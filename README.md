It is a complaint registration portal using node js. Portal is only for the employees of the company to register a complaint related to any department
The employees have their own login credentials and it is made sure that there is no redundancy in the data.
For the frontend part we used Bootstrap templates. This includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
For the backend part of the project we used the Node JS to connect the server side and the client side.
The data is stored using the MongoDB database. 
There is also the feature of automatic geolacation capture in this project. While registering the complaint it will automatically capture the longitude and latitude
of the place from where the location is being captured. There may be the case when the employee registers complaint from different location, so for that currently 
we have added the description part where the employee has to add the location manually.
We are also assigning a unique complaint id to each of the complaints registered.
Employees can also add photos of the accident sight. That photo without being saved on the server, will be renamed as the complaint id and stored in the uploads 
folder of the directory.

FUTURE WORKS:
Creation of an admin page with the status of the complaint.
Passing on the complaints to the respective departments.
Complaint confirmation mail or whatsapp message to the employee.
Complaints status page creation.
